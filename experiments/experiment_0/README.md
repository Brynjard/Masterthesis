## Experiment #0: Reproduce Baidu with NetVLAD++.
---
- In order to set a baseline we use the Baidu features with the NetVLAD++ model. 
- Baidu Research achieved higher performance using their features compared to ResNet 

- Performance metric: Average mAP on all events. 
- We use NetVLAD++ since the model is a part of the SoccerNetv2 dev-kit and therefore ready-to-use. The different features can be utilized with an command line argument.
